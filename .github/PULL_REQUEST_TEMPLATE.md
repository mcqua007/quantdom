## Pull Request template
Please, go through these steps before you submit a PR.

1. Make sure that your PR is not a duplicate.
2. If not, then make sure that:

    a. You have done your changes in a separate branch. Branches MUST have descriptive names that start with either the `username/feautre-[describe]` or `username/fix-[describe]. Good examples are: `bob22/fix-signin-issue` or `bob22/feature-issue-templates`.

    b. You have a descriptive commit message with a short title (first line). Commits should have format describe in contributing [docs](CONTRIBUTING.md).

    c. You have only one commit (if not, squash them into one commit).

    d. `npm test` doesn't throw any error. If it does, fix them first and amend your commit (`git commit --amend`).

3. **After** these steps, you're ready to open a pull request.

    a. Your pull request should target the `master` branch on this repository.

    b. Give a descriptive title to your PR.

    c. Provide a description of your changes.

    d. Put `closes #XXXX` in your comment to auto-close the issue that your PR fixes (if such).

** Refer to Commits contributing [docs](CONTRIBUTING.md) before requesting or adding a new feature. Also look at the checklist if wanting to add a new utility method.
